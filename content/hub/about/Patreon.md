Hey there!

I've been on a creative journey with pixels and code since 1984, starting with the ZX Spectrum and exploring everything from Deluxe Paint and Photoshop to Maya and finally GIMP. Crafting tools and creating artwork is my passion.

If you've enjoyed my work and found it helpful, consider showing your support with a small donation. It’s a simple way to say "thanks" and keep the creativity flowing! Your support helps cover the costs of software development, tutorials, and ongoing artistic projects.

You can do this through Patreon, a platform many creatives use to receive direct support:
