Welcome to the technical guides for Lumi.

These guides document practical workflows used while developing and maintaining Lumi on Debian-based Linux systems. They focus on real working environments rather than general Linux theory.

Topics covered include Lumi development, debugging, automation, system setup, and supporting tools used in daily production workflows.
