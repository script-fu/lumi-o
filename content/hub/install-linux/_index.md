Welcome to the Linux installation guides for Lumi.

These guides document the operating system setup used for Lumi development and testing. They are intended for artists and developers who want a stable, reproducible Linux environment rather than a customised or experimental configuration.

The focus is on Debian-based systems chosen for reliability and long-term consistency. Each guide follows a practical, step-by-step approach aimed at helping users move from an existing system to a known working setup with minimal uncertainty.

Topics include Debian installation, system configuration and backups.
