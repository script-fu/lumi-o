Lumi is not released yet, it is available as a developement version.

If you are already on Linux and want to run Lumi quickly, use the latest **development AppImage** from GitLab artifacts:

https://gitlab.gnome.org/pixelmixer/lumi-dev/-/artifacts

1. Download the latest development AppImage artifact zip.
2. Open a terminal in your download directory.
3. Make the file executable.
4. Run it.

```bash
chmod +x Lumi*.AppImage
./Lumi*.AppImage
```

If you want to work from source, go to [Technical Guides](/hub/technical-guides/) and [How to Install Linux](/hub/install-linux/).
