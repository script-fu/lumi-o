First Steps introduces functional patterns that work well in Scheme, with short examples and incremental refactors.
By the end, you'll have built your own custom messaging library and have a solid foundation to continue developing more advanced plug-ins.

### What You Need

Before you get started, ensure you have the following:

- Lumi installed (a recent build or AppImage).
- A text editor for `.scm` files (VS Code works well): [Visual Studio Code](/hub/scripting/tools/visual-studio-code)
- [Git](/hub/scripting/tools/git/) to keep your code backed-up and version controlled.
