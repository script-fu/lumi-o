## What is Visual Studio Code?

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (often shortened to "VS Code" or "VSC") is a free, open-source text editor developed by Microsoft, designed specifically for coding. It’s lightweight, fast, and highly customizable, making it one of the most popular code editors among developers. Here's why VSC is a great choice:

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Syntax highlighting color-codes your code, making it easier to spot errors, understand structure, and read complex code.
- **Extensions**: You can enhance VSC with thousands of extensions. Whether you need support for a specific language, theme, or tool, you can find an extension that fits.
- **Version Control Integration**: VSC has built-in Git support, making it easy to track your code changes, manage branches, using services like [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/).

### Key Features for Beginners

- **Workspaces**: VSC allows you to organize multiple projects into "workspaces," which let you keep related files and folders together for easier navigation and project management.

- **Profiles**: With profiles, you can create different setups for various projects or tasks. You might use one profile for web development and another for Scheme programming, each with its own specific extensions, themes, and settings.

### Getting Started with Visual Studio Code

To start using VSC:

- **Download and Install**: Go to the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the Linux version.

- **Explore the Interface**: When you open VSC, you'll notice several panels. On the left, you have the **Activity Bar**, where you can navigate between files, search, use Git, and install extensions.

- **Open a File or Folder**: Set-up your workspace by adding the folder where your project is stored, and save the active configuration to a workspace file.

A workspace is just a saved folder view plus editor settings for your project.

### Extensions

- **Install Extensions**: Click on the **Extensions** icon in the Activity Bar to browse and install helpful tools for Scheme. The main one to install is **"vscode-scheme"** by Allen Huang. This extension provides syntax highlighting and basic support for Scheme, which is the base language for Scheme.

You can also customize the extension by editing the language file to include more Scheme-specific keywords or anything related to Lumi scripting.

If you maintain your own helper library, adding your project’s function names to the syntax highlighter makes navigation and refactoring faster.

### Conclusion

Use an editor that makes it easy to search, refactor, and run quick edits. VS Code + a Scheme extension is a solid baseline.
