Modern AI tools can significantly accelerate Lumi plug-in development by acting as a collaborative coding partner.

## VS Code in Agent Mode

Using Visual Studio Code with an AI assistant in **Agent mode** (such as GitHub Copilot's Agent mode or other tool-enabled assistants) allows you to perform complex, multi-step tasks using natural language.

Instead of just completing a single line of code, an Agent can:
- Read your entire workspace to understand context.
- Create new files and directories.
- Run terminal commands to test or validate scripts.
- Search for existing patterns in your codebase.

## Repository Access

AI assistance is most effective when the Agent has access to the **lumi-dev** or your specific project repository. With visibility into the existing codebase, the Agent can:
- Use the **[Utility Libraries]({{< ref "/hub/scripting/reference/utility-browser" >}})** as a reference for helper functions.
- Follow existing patterns for GEGL operations and layer management.
- Re-use boilerplate code from established plug-ins.

## Example Workflow

You can directly ask the Agent to generate a full plug-in by describing the desired functional outcome:

> "Using the available Scheme utilities and examples in the workspace, write a new plug-in that creates a 50% horizontal guide on the active image and names it 'Center Guide'."

The Agent will search for how to create guides, identify the correct utility function (like `lumi-image-add-hguide-percent` from `common.scm`), and generate the complete `.scm` file with the correct registration boilerplate.

## Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: Describe exactly what you want the plug-in to do.
- **Reference Utilities**: Encourage the Agent to look at the `share/lumi/scripts/` directory for high-level helpers.
- **Review and Test**: Always test the plug-in generated by the AI, it's often an iterative and creative process.
